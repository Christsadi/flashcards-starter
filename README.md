# Codecademy Challenge Project - Flashcards

Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe this project. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and I used github, Codecademy (Forum), when I encountered a problem that I could not easily solve.

In this project, I practice using Redux and Redux Toolkit to manage the complex state of a flashcard-style quiz app. Users will be able to create their own topics, quizzes for those topics, and flashcards for those quizzes. Users will also be able to interact with their quizzes by flipping flashcards over.
